    <h4>Ecuador</h4>
    <span class="sentence">Visiting Quito wasn't too much of a culture shock because it was basically another densely populated city on a grid system (should be on the left).</span>
    <span class="sentence">Nearing the new year witness a tradition of incinerating pinata or rag doll versions of your old self on the streets! (should be on the right).</span>

    <h4>Helpful Travel Tips</h4>
    <p> To get the best experience, I would book a bus travel tour guide. Quito is a very walkable city but by bus you can travel outside of the capital to see other cities and come back within the same day. Luckily you can receive a 20% discount through my site because my family runs a tourist travel guide business! Not my family's business, but just as good. <a href="https://www.saexpeditions.com/destinations/galapagos-tours?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=PMax_Galapagos&utm_term=&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw7Py4BhCbARIsAMMx-_IZ7TQNfpLZfJKW5oIIL3vHmFTe0pbaZzFWcR4SLaizx1eCpGQ7DM8aAqokEALw_wcB">Galapagos Tour Guide</a></p>
